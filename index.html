            <p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <p>My name is Eric Hopkins, I live in Redford, MI.</p>
                <!--This is temporary, periodically update-->I'm currently just 3 months out from graduating from Schoolcraft College.
                I've had a life long love for computers and technology, building computers and fiddling with hardware.
                In 2010, I started learning to develop software. I was first taught on .NET, but have become more fond of
                Java and other platform agnostic languages.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I first got excited about software development because I thought the idea of making video games was unbelievably cool.
                I've since fallen in love with the process more than the end product.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I'm seriously passionate about what I do, I find it legitimately fun. I believe that along with constant work,
                one of the best ways to get better is to put what I do out for all to see. I upload everything I do now to GitHub.
                I'm constantly growing, and looking to not just get; but earn my place.

                Along with going to school, I'm a big fan of learning on my own time.<br/><br/>
                <p>
                    The classroom is great, but it's not enough. Education doesn't end with school, especially with
                    the ever expanding world of tech.

            <br/>
            <p>
                Outside of computers and technology, I'm a huge history buff. When I first started college back in 2008,
                it's what I went in for. I even ended up getting an Associate of Arts degree out of it. I realized however,
                that it wasn't my calling.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I still love reading and learning about it on my own time. My personal favorite period is early medieval europe;
                but I would challenge anyone to find a time or place they couldn't get me excited about.

                <p>
                    Originally video games and science fiction mostly. I was introduced to the game BattleTech early in my
                    life. That probably had something to do with loving computers and machines.

                    <p>
                        Pronounced "in 3D". I was always trying to find creative ways to change common usernames I had because
                        they would be frequently already taken. I came up with IN3D, in 4 years I've only found it in use once.
                        So it's become my online handle.
